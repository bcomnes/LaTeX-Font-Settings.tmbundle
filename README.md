# LaTeX-Font-Settings.tmbundle

A simple bundle used to increase the visual font size of sections in a latex document within Textmate, similar to how TextMate 2 treates Mardown files.  This increased visual cue helps with identifying the different parts of your document, even when scrolling or jumping around the document rapidly.
