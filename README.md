# LaTeX-Font-Settings.tmbundle

A simple bundle used to increase the visual font size of sections in a LaTeX document while editing with TextMate, similar to how TextMate 2 treates Mardown headers.  This increased visual cue helps with identifying the different sections your LaTeX document, even when scrolling or jumping around the document rapidly.

## How to install

Just navigate to the bundle menu in the TextMate 2 preferences, search and install!
